# Weakly_Supervised_Iris_Segmentation_with_XAI
 
Using weakly-supervised approach, We developed a Classification and Segmentation model using cuttingedge CNNs(ResNet, GoogLeNet) on the Iris dataset, achieving a training accuracy around 98% and a test top-1 accuracy around 87%. Implemented Explainable AI techniques like GradCAM and GradCAM++ to enhance model interpretability, providing insights into feature importance and decision making processes.
